# RPI Machines Map #


This is a webapp that will allow users to easily find machine shops on campus, and the contents of those shops. This project exists as a branch of [RPI Interactive Campus Map](CM_README.md).

RPI Machines Map has a map legend that allows users to view regular campus locations (non-shop locations), just machine shops, or both. The machine shops are also searchable by the machines at their sites, allowing users to know where to go on campus, based on their mechanical needs.

This project was originally commissioned by Sam Chiappone (Director of Manufacturing Innovation) and Scott Yerbury (Electromechanical Technician/ Machine Shops Manager). It is now being developed and maintained through the Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS).
